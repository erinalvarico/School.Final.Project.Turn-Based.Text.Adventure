# School.Final.Project.Turn-Based.Text.Adventure
The steps to completing the final version of my first Freshman programming project with Python. 

University: Marist College
Class: Intro to Programming
Project Type: Final Graded Project

Personally, I loved creating this short text adventure, it took me roughly 4 days to complete! In my senior year of high school I had already learned Javascript, and to my disappointment I found that I could not create a more published look to my game... (My professor had to launch my code in the actual editor: PyCharm). Regardless, I passed with an overwhelmingly positive grade, but still would like to further my skills to create more effective code for future games.

I would love to hear valuable feedback on how to make my code run more efficiently (Working on it, I realized how many messy loops I had within each other). This adventure is 80% pure story, but I decided to attempt a turn based battle sequence as well.


I'm particularly looking for suggestions on how to create a less cluttered, polished version of my project. the areas where I had the most trouble were:

1. Looping the class selection for the protagonist.
(I still believe there's a way to break the loop process and select the class...)
Overall I think I fixed the looping for this segment, but once again, reading through the loops become just too confusing. Perhaps there's a better way to organize the options?

2. The turn-based battle.
(It's still a bit of a mess, as the choices were a bit hasty since I was running out of time...I believe I tried organizing everything through storing character information in arrays, however many times I made a mistake of calling the wrong variable...)
Overall in the battle sequence, it runs and gets the job done, but is bland and rather an eye-sore to sift through the actual code. If there's a way to differentiate the different choices better than I did, I'd greatly appreciate the suggestions!


I hope to post more of my projects on here to measure my learning and development through my career. 
Thank you for those who are willing to give feedback!
