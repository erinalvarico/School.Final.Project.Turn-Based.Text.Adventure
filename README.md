# School.Final.Project.Turn-Based.Text.Adventure
The final version of my first freshman programming project with Python. Personally, I loved creating this short text adventure, it took me roughly 4 days to complete! In my senior year of high school I had already learned Javascript, and to my disappointment I found that I could not create a more published look to my game (My professor had to launch my code in the actual editor: PyCharm). I would love to hear valuable feedback on how to make my code run more efficiently (Working on it, I realized how many messy loops I had within each other). This adventure is 80% pure story, but I decided to attempt a turn based battle sequence as well.
